# Chat app
Just a Windows 95 styled messaging app so I get to practice backend related things(API, DB, ORM), and doing some frontend that's not copying some other website.

# Things you can do
- Move window around.
- Some CLI command
    - `/about` will print out introduction of the app.
    - `/nickname` allow you to change your name in chat.
    - `/help` will print out lists of command avaliable.
